# Notes & Thinking

### The notebook is going to show some thinks and notes in my process.

### For Front-end
1. I am going to build separation of front and back ends for this small app. 
For front-end, I would like to use vanilla React + Redux, don't want to include any heavy libraries.
2. Try to init my React app. 
3. Separating my application to components. 
4. Using Antd library as UI framework library.
5. Lazy loading has been done in 'LandingPage'
6. Add Redux as a state management 
7. Validate data from backend
8. Add Eslint to clean code and enforce the code style
9. Write a simple unit test for 'SearchBar' component via Enzyme
10. Add error notice for user
11. Add CSS to makeup the app


### For Back-end
1. Init koa project
2. Apply for twitter api key 
3. Create API for frontend to get data
4. Validate data collect from the third party
5. Add middleware to create log files


## Future Work
1. More unit test for frontend (enzyme+jest)
2. More unit test for backend (mocha)
3. Build in docker & Deploy on cloud
4. Consider CI/CD 
5. Add type check on both side.
